# WELCOME TO THE FORGE!
HakoForge will share 3D models and documentation on this repo. Our hope for this project is to have the community's ideas and visions brought to life. 

It is currently in a preview state. These models and documents do not represent the final product. They will soon as we prepare for shipping in December.

# Cages and PCBs
There are two form factors for the HakoCore system:
Standard form factor
Mini form factor
These form factors will be consistant throughout our product line up. This will allow us to develop future products that you will be commpatible your HakoCore in the future. We have many in the pipeline but want to hear from the community on what they would like to see made. 

If you have a knack for 3D modeling, you can use our models as a base and create something unique for your own use. Our PCBs will be available for individual purchase.

# Documentation
User manuals and user guides will be hosted here. The HakoForge system will be continually evolving. There may be changes and new additions to the documentation.

# Community
Join our discord and other socials to share your ideas with us. We want to make your vision a reality.
