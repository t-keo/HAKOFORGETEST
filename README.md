# WELCOME TO THE FORGE!
HakoForge will share 3D models and documentation on this repo. Our hope for this project is to have the community's ideas contribute to the development of the products. Join our Discord to see what others are doing with their HakoCore and let us know what you would like to see.

# HakoCore User Manual
[Latest Version (V1.0)](https://hakoforge.com/)

User manuals and user guides will be hosted on our [GitHub](https://github.com/t-keo/HAKOFORGETEST). The HakoCore will be continually evolving and documentation may be changed or updated. 

# Cages and PCBs
There are two form factors for the HakoCore system:
Standard form factor
Mini form factor
These form factors will be consistant throughout our product line up. This will allow us to develop future products that you will be commpatible your HakoCore in the future. We have many in the pipeline but want to hear from the community on what they would like to see made. 

If you have a knack for 3D modeling, you can use our models as a base and create something unique for your own use. Our PCBs will be available for individual purchase.
